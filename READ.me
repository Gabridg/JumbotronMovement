The <header> and <footer> tags are not to supposed to be taken in consideration; 
just copy and paste style.css, script.js and then give to your Jumbotron the correct ID.
In my case the ID to take consideration is id="jumbotron" so all the style or script you will find in the previous
mentioned file is referred to id="jumbotron".

For any issue text me on Instagram (GabridgDeveloper);
You're welcome for any type of advice or contribute.
